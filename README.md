## Summary

The analyzed data shows that the mean, min and max temperature in June and December are relatively the same. It appears that that there is not a drastic change between the two months and that a Surf and Shake could serve ice cream in June and December. To get a better understanding of the weather in June and December, I would pull temperature information for July, August, September, October, and November. I would also pull information regarding storm systems and rain fall between June and December. This information will allow for a better understanding of how many people might visit Oauh, Hawaii and what projected sales for the Surf and Shake may be like.
